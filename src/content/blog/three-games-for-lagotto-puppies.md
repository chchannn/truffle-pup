Here's the thing about Lagotto Romagnolo puppies: they're not normal puppies. They're *wired differently*. That curly head is running calculations you can't see — tracking scents, solving problems, figuring out how to open the treat drawer when you're not looking.

Regular fetch? Sure, they'll do it. For about four minutes. Then they're bored and they're eating your shoe.

These three games are built for the Lagotto brain. They tap into what makes this breed tick — the nose, the drive, the need to *work*. Play these and watch your puppy light up like they just found a truffle the size of a baseball.

## 1. The Two-Ball Hustle

Forget regular fetch. Your Lagotto is too smart for that. The two-ball game is where it gets interesting.

**How it works:** Grab two balls and throw them both at the same time, in different directions. Here's the beautiful part — your puppy can only carry one ball in their mouth. So they'll chase down the first one, bring it back, and then suddenly remember: *wait, there's another one out there.* Off they go, nose to the ground, searching for ball number two. It turns a simple game of fetch into a retrieval *and* a search mission.

**Why Lagottos love it:** That second ball turns your puppy into a detective. They can't just see it and run — they have to *find* it. You'll watch their nose drop, their whole body shift into search mode, and that Lagotto brain light up. It's fetch meets treasure hunt, and it hits both their retriever instincts and their drive to search.

**Pro tip:** Use balls that bounce unpredictably on grass. Lagottos love the chaos. Their eyes get huge and they do that adorable head-tilt thing before launching after it like a curly missile.

## 2. The Hot Dog Hunt

This is the one that will make your Lagotto think you're the greatest human who ever lived.

**How it works:** Cut up hot dogs into small cubes — maybe a quarter inch each. While your puppy is in another room (or have someone hold them), scatter the cubes around a section of your floor, under furniture edges, behind chair legs, in corners. Start easy with cubes in plain sight. As they get better, make it harder — under a towel, behind a box, tucked next to a table leg.

**Why Lagottos love it:** This is literally what they were bred to do. For centuries, Lagotto Romagnoli have been hunting truffles — using their extraordinary noses to find something hidden beneath the surface. The hot dog hunt taps directly into that ancient wiring. You'll see the switch flip. Their nose drops to the ground, their body language changes, and suddenly your goofy puppy looks like a seasoned professional working a truffle forest in Emilia-Romagna.

**Pro tip:** Don't help them. Resist the urge to point. Let that nose do the work. When they find one, celebrate like they just discovered gold. The confidence this builds is incredible.

## 3. The Spice Cabinet Challenge

This one sounds weird. Trust me on it.

**How it works:** Grab three or four small containers — cups, jars, whatever you have. Put a tiny amount of a kitchen spice in one of them. Cinnamon, oregano, turmeric — something with a strong, distinct smell. Leave the others empty. Line them up and let your puppy sniff along the row. When they linger on the right one — and they will — reward them immediately.

Once they get it, start rotating which container has the spice. Then add more containers. Then space them further apart.

**Why Lagottos love it:** You're basically running a beginner scent detection class, and your Lagotto is the star student. This breed has one of the most sensitive noses in the dog world. While other puppies are still figuring out that their nose does things, your Lagotto is already discriminating between oregano and thyme like a tiny Italian chef.

This game also wears them out *mentally*, which is the secret weapon of Lagotto ownership. A twenty-minute nose work session will tire them out more than an hour of running around. You'll finish and they'll curl up and sleep like they just ran a marathon.

**Pro tip:** Keep sessions short — ten to fifteen minutes max. You want to stop while they're still excited, not after they've lost interest. And switch up the spice regularly. These dogs get bored with repetition faster than you'd believe.

## Why These Games Matter

Look, you can play tug-of-war and basic fetch with any dog. But you didn't get *any dog*. You got a Lagotto Romagnolo — a breed with centuries of working heritage, a nose that borders on supernatural, and a brain that needs engagement the way other dogs need walks.

These games aren't just fun. They're building the foundation for a happy, confident, well-adjusted dog. And here's the bonus — every single one of these is laying groundwork for nosework and truffle hunting training down the road. The two-ball game builds drive and retrieval instincts. The hot dog hunt teaches systematic searching. The spice challenge develops scent discrimination — the exact skill they'll need when you graduate to real truffle training.

You're not just playing with your puppy. You're building a truffle dog. A Lagotto with a job is a Lagotto who isn't eating your drywall.

Play with purpose. Your curly genius will thank you.
