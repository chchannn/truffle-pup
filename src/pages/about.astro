      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        We are a small, family-based Lagotto Romagnolo breeder dedicated to preserving the breed's
        wonderful characteristics — their intelligence, loyalty, and gentle nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our dogs are raised in our home as part of the family. Every puppy receives early
        socialization, exposure to various environments, and the foundation for a well-adjusted life
        with their new families.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        We believe in quality over quantity. Our breeding decisions are guided by health, temperament,
        and breed standard. Every parent is health-tested, and we stand behind the puppies we produce.
      </p>

      <h2>Health Testing</h2>
      <p>
        All our breeding dogs undergo comprehensive health testing including hip and elbow evaluations,
        eye examinations, and genetic testing for breed-specific conditions. We are committed to
        producing the healthiest puppies possible.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Lagotto Romagnolo?</h2>
      <p>
        The Lagotto Romagnolo is a remarkable breed — originally bred as a water retriever in Italy,
        they became famous as truffle hunters. Today, they make exceptional family companions.
        Their hypoallergenic, curly coat and moderate size make them well-suited for many lifestyles.
