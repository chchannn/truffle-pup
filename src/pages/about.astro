      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        It started on a bicycle trip through Italy. I stayed with a host family who had these
        curly, bright-eyed dogs that followed me around the property like we'd known each other
        forever. I didn't know what breed they were — I just knew I'd never felt anything like it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirty years later, from my farm in the Pacific Northwest, I reached back out to that
        family. Their daughter connected me with an Italian truffle hunter whose Lagotto Romagnoli
        had won championships in competition. I flew three puppies across the Atlantic, and
        Lagotto Romagnolo PNW was born.

      <p>
        Today we are a small, family-based breeder dedicated to preserving the breed's
        wonderful characteristics — their intelligence, loyalty, and gentle nature.
        Every puppy is raised in our home, with early socialization, exposure to various
        environments, and a strong foundation for life with their new families.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        We believe in quality over quantity. Our breeding decisions are guided by health, temperament,
        and breed standard. Every parent is health-tested, and we stand behind the puppies we produce.
      </p>

      <h2>Health Testing</h2>
      <p>
        All our breeding dogs undergo comprehensive health testing including hip and elbow evaluations,
        eye examinations, and genetic testing for breed-specific conditions. We are committed to
        producing the healthiest puppies possible.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Lagotto Romagnolo?</h2>
      <p>
        The Lagotto Romagnolo is a remarkable breed — originally bred as a water retriever in Italy,
        they became famous as truffle hunters. Today, they make exceptional family companions.
        Their hypoallergenic, curly coat and moderate size make them well-suited for many lifestyles.
